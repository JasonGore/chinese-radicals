# Setup

## Prerequisites

A client set up for [React Native development](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup).

## Launching

From repo root:
1. In one terminal, launch `npx react-native start` and keep it running.
1. In another terminal, compile the target of your choice:
   1. For Android, `npx react-native run-android`.
   2. For iOS, `npx react-native run-ios`.

If your environment is completely set up per prerequisites, an emulator should automatically launch (if not already started) with the app running.

## Editing Code

Use an editor of your choice. Changing source files should reflect changes immediately in the app if already launched. The terminal running `npx react-native start` will report any compilation errors as you edit code. [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a good option having integrated TypeScript and IDE features just by opening repo root.
